Unity Cloud Build TeamCity Bridge
===
### v0.0.1

Processes webhooks from Unity Cloud builds and triggers Teamcity builds.

This is useful for generating a wrapping server or service in Teamcity for Unity Cloud webgl builds.

It is built on `koa`, processed via `babel`, bundled with `webpack` and served by `nodemon`

### How do I get setup?

`npm install`

### How do I run the server locally?

`npm run watch` - will update source code as you save it
`npm start` - will start the koa server

### How do I deploy?

TBD
